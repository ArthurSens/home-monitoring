Simple setup to monitor my stuff at home.

Also an opportunity to build some data to work with for my Prometheus contributions.

# TODO:

* Data exploration:
  * I have network problems every day, still couldn't discover where is the problem
  * Sometimes, all my CPU is consumed at once, not sure why... I need to add an proccess exporter to the setup
* Alert routing:
  * I'd like to receive alerts on my phone, because I'm addicted to it :D
